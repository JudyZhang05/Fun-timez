                    <p>This website was the final project developed for Hunter College's MEDP 285 - Web Production I course. 
                        The project required me to design a wireframe with responsiveness and create a professionally oriented website. The topic I chose is a start-up company on stickers and scrapbooking material for all ages. The wide range of target audiences is purposely intended as a way to become the main source that people will flock to when they either need to restock their never-ending collection, start their scrapbooking journey, or simply gift stationery items for friends and family. This website is presented on the web in a welcoming, friendly, and accessible way. Where categories have both their distinct borders and intertwine in an alluring way. Additionally, the products would be transparent with everything, from its manufacturer to its commissioned artist. The company aims to gain the full trust and complete assurance of its customers to ensure a successful user experience.

                        collaboratively to modify a LinkedIn clone website and track the user's interaction. Throughout the development of Klicky, we split into 2 different groups dedicated to various areas of the project. I was tasked with 
                    HTML/CSS and  Firebase Database Team. In HTML/CSS, I utilized my knowledge in HTML/CSS and focused primarily on the presentation of the website, some tasks I completed were adding new sections to the website to diversify the 
                    interactions available to the user, manipulated the scale of individual sections, added posts to replicate an active platform, creating mouse effects for a more engaging experience, and more. In the Firebase Database team, I focused on 
                    collecting and keeping track of user's interaction with the webpage and adding them to a firebase database. When the user clicks on a button or anywhere on the screen, it would automatically append itself to the database instantly.</p>
