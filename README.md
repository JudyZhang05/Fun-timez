# Meet Judy Zhang
Hello There! I am currently a Hunter College Undergraduate majoring in Emerging Media and minoring in Computer Science. 
With a strong fondation in fine arts and a burning passion for UI/UX Design and Front-end Web Development, I've designed and developed captivating and intuitive webpages for a variety of audiences. 
Got an interesting project to work on? Expand your horizons with me and aim for the stars! âœ¨

#### Side Notes:
* This is my website portfolio where you can find the projects I've poured my soul into from programs like BreakThrough Tech Sprinternships and college Web-Development/Production courses.
* I will diligently update this site with new and exciting works, so stay tuned!
