    title: "Dreamer",
    software: "Adobe Photoshop",
    date: "June 2021",
    description: "The piece 'Dreamer' was one of the first works I created when I transitioned into a digital artist. Needless to say, I am still an amateur when it comes to digital illustrations and was very ambitious in my practice pieces. I call this work the 'Dreamer'. After all, like the subject in the artwork, I am weary of how sometimes my enthusiastic nature hinders me from actual progress because I restrict myself to small irrelevant details. As much as this drawing was a practice, it was also a reflection of myself and from it, I was able to grow both mentally and artistically. In this piece, I used a very muted color palette giving off solemn emotions. The distressed subject with the skewed rubble in the background compliments the atmosphere. The illuminating golden hair shares the emotional turmoil the subject is feeling, almost as if representing their yearning for freedom with it blowing freely in the air."

    title: "Friends",
    software: "Adobe Photoshop",
    date: "September 2021",
    description: "The illustration 'Friends' was a study on emotion and reflected light. The main subject is drawn laying on her side facing an illuminated lock screen with the notification of 'no new messages' signaling that they are waiting for some sort of response or update. The sorrowful facial expression paired with the dull hues conveys to the audience its dreary atmosphere and foreboding tone. The light that is emanating from the phone's screen is hyper-highlighted throughout the subject because of the dark and gloomy surroundings. The face and pillow are especially taken into consideration due to its closer distance from the light source."
  },
  details3 = {
    title: "Revelation Day",
    software: "Adobe Photoshop",
    date: "August 2021",
    description: "The artwork 'Revelation Day' is fan art of the popular webtoon 'Remarried Empress'. The subject in the piece is the character named 'Navier', her most identifying features being her stern demeanor, emerald green eyes, and lustrous golden hair fit for an empress of two nations. Her signature appearance is red velvet ball gowns adorned with heavy flamboyant jewelry and of course, a golden crown to represent her royalty. With all these elements in mind, I composed the illustration in a perspective where it seems as though she is looking down from the high rank she is in along with a fitting expression to show how sophisticated and regal she is. In the portrait, her eyes are the only green element within the piece, this grabs the viewer's attention to it first. Attached to the red gown is a fluffy of white fur akin to those on a royal cape. Additionally, her body and hair are adorned with pearls and golden red gems to further enhance her unreachable status. Last but not least, the background is designed to sort of abstractly to not bring away any attention from the main subject."

  details4 = {
    title: "New Year Motivation",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "December 2021",
    description: "I was commissioned by a relative to design a chinese new year poster. This poster would be posted on doors outside the building to set a happy mood for those upon entering or passing by. With this in mind, I made sure to design this poster to be as eye-catching as possible. I wanted the poster to resemble as much as possible the loud and bright celebrations of Chinese New Year. For this, I designed a large chinese firecracker. The light and dramatic perspective implemented in the design is made to draw the audience into the piece and immerse them excitement for the new year. The firecracker and golden ingot are developed with depth for a smooth appearance. The text’s drop shadow is to as much as possible match to the drawing style, as to not make the composition too awkward. The two toned background enhances and directs the attention towards the text and explosion occurring on the ride side."

    title: "The Perfect Daisy",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "July 2022",
    description: "These illustrations were designed for Marc Jacobs Back to School Contest submission. The client offered students to design both or one of the products between “Daisy” and “Perfect”. The purpose of having students create the design was to fulfill their vision of having the new generation incorporate younger audiences’ style and definition of “what makes you you” within their product. Initially I went with just one product having to focus more on accentuating the abstract meaning of “perfect”. The way I interpreted this topic was to redefine the word to match a more modern preference-abstract. Later I decided to challenge myself to compose both the offered products to one coherent design. For the daisy perfume, I was more direct. While maintaining the first perfume’s style, I implemented the product’s ingredients while giving it a more spring, honey, flowery feel within. Additionally, knowing that the would be chosen design would be advertised and used within a mall and social media, I took the liberty to study their seasonal color palette for their media posts and decided to implement it to maintain the same consistency."
  },
  details6 = {
    title: "DragonFruit",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "February 2022",
    description: "This design was created for the informative purpose of advertising a healthy fruit while highlighting it’s positive benefits for people. By promoting and informing more people of these healthier choices, I decided to design this poster with more vibrantly alluring elements. The pastel palette brings the audience’s to a more positive mood. The addition of the sakura like leaves near the foreground brings depth to the poster and leads the audience to the singular dragon fruit near the center. The green accent on the dragonfruit brings the whole piece together while adding a pop of a complementary color. The simple yet complex design with the addition of careful placement of hierarchy of text creates for a captivating piece."

    title: "Distant Castle",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "October 2021",
    description: "This piece depicts a large scaled fantasy like castle from a distance and perspective of an explorer encountering an abandoned property."

    title: "Jaded Value",
    software: "Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "December 2021",

    title: "Faculty and Staff Art Show",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "Ocotber 2021",
    description: "A poster advertising the date and location of LaGuardia Highschool staff art show. The design was focused to be abstract while carrying the sprint season which the event was taking place during, while showing an all encompassing and welcoming atmosphere for the viewer."
  },
  details11 = {
    title: "A Midsummer Night's Dream",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "April 2022",
    description: "A poster advertising the Midsummer Night Dream play. The design for this poster was aimed to encapsulate a lucid dream that one will partake on when watching the play. The contrasting foreground and background hues guide the viewers eyes the title down to the subjects poised in an intimate scene."

  details12 = {
    title: "The Tempest",
    software: "Adobe Illustrator",
    date: "March 2021",
    description: "A poster advertising The Tempest play. This poster design focuses on the emotional and lament rollercoaster the play will submerge the audience in. The visually sorrowful expression the main subject wears draws the viewer's attention from her pleading stance to the title and play information back to their eyes."
